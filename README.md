# Target Dataset Exploration: Uncovering E-Commerce Trends with SQL & Python

## Overview
This project dives into behavioral and transactional data in the e-commerce space, utilizing SQL for data extraction and transformation, and Python (via Google Colab) for visual analysis. The goal is to guide learners and professionals through a three-tiered analytical journey—from beginner queries to advanced business insights—while demonstrating hands-on mastery and storytelling clarity.
